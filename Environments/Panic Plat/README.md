# Panic Enviro Enhanced
The first ever environment I made, very good for a larger variety of songs.

<h1> Static Environment</h1>

<h1> How to use</h1>
All light ID's remain the same. Lasers are scattered around the environment, back lasers are the pillars in the middle. Rings remain the same, and window remains the same.
