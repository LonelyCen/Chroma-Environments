# BTS Enviro Enhanced
*Done by Lonely*

You may recognize this environment from "The 15 Sublimit" map Mawntee and myself did. This is the origional edit for the
environment!

# BTS Witch Edit
This edit of the environment was done by Fatalution. Concept is the same, but with the highway readded, and the cube circle made perfectly even around the center piece.

# How to use
Most of the lights remain the same as origional BTS, with some modifications. The center beam is inner ring ID 5 (or 9, 10, 11, 12 in extended ID mode). The logo is removed, but
you can use it to create a bloom effect on the cubes and the side rings (ID's for the center light are default).
