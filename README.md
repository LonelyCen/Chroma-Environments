# Lonelys-Environments
Here you can find a repository of all my custom environments I have done that you can use in your own maps!

<h1> Important Info</h1>
     Even though the environments are all free to use, make sure to credit me in some way for the environment creation if its left untouched. Where you leave credit doesn't matter
     as long as it is given :D 
     
  Editing the environments is also fine with me, again, just make sure its specified. For example, Environment by Lonely (Edited by *Your name*)! 
 
 If I find any environments that were yoinked without credit, I'll be very sad :(

<h1> Requirements</h1>

All environment's will be made for the newest version of Beat Saber with fixes *hopefully* coming out as soon as they are needed


Chroma 2.5.4

Heck 1.3.0

CustomJSONData 2.0.7

<h1> Extra Information</h1>

   If you want any extra help with anything in reguards to environment enhancements, questions/help with anything chroma related, feel free
   to DM me on discord :D ---> Lone#5260
